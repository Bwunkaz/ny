        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>The Music</h2>
        <p>I have previously studied and worked in the music industry. Most recently I worked on a film called UFO-Sweden which just came out on Netflix. Apart from film music I love creating Pop-music on a hobbie-level but hope to be able to work with it someday in the future. </p>
        <h2>Career Change</h2>
        <p>The Royal Institute Of Music is where I first got introduced to programming. I was given the opportunity to test a little bit of HTML and CSS and liked it from the start. It's been a while since I went to college but lately I've been getting a large renewed passion for coding and have decided to pursue a career in Front End Development. </p>
